<h1>Description about the application</h1>

<h4>This application coded using Xamarin Platform which is Front-End side and MongoDB which is Back-End side. </h4>

<p>Thanks to GoldenShelf, our books which are read by us, will not stay on the our shelves and will contribute to recycling.</p>
<p> It is a mobile application which can using for exchanging or donating book by users to other users. User can publish an advert then contact with other users and deal with them. Like Letgo which is active in Google PlayStore.</p>
<p>If you create .apk folder and install your phone you can see all of the adverts and use it as you wish. Application working on MongoDB Atlas free, We have 512MB storage space so, please don't add too much adverts or users :)</p>
<p>It's a cross platform applicaton but I did not develop IOS side of the app because I have not MacOS Device</p>
<p> If you want to change MongoDB Connection String, you can easily found it inside the ViewModels! </p>
